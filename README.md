# Teachable-AI-ML
Teachable AI/ML is a beginner-friendly project that helps students and learners understand the basics of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). With a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frontend, users can upload data, train simple models, and visualize how AI learns step by step—without needing complex tools or frameworks.
🎓 Educational Goals
Learn how datasets are used to train AI.
Understand the difference between classification, regression, and clustering.
See training progress with real-time visualizations.
Experiment with different parameters to compare results.
Export models for reuse in projects.
🚀 Features
📂 Upload Data: Load CSV files or images into the platform.
⚡ No Frameworks Needed: Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
📊 Visual Training: Watch accuracy and loss values change as the model learns.
🤖 Prebuilt Models: Train simple models like decision trees or linear regression.
🧩 Interactive Controls: Adjust training settings (learning rate, epochs, etc.).
💾 Export Models: Save trained models for future use.
🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
ML Libraries: TensorFlow.js (for in-browser training)
Visualization: Chart.js / D3.js
📦 Installation & Setup
Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/teachable-ai-ml.git
cd teachable-ai-ml
Open the project
Since this is a web-based project, simply open index.html in your browser.
open index.html   # Mac
start index.html  # Windows
(If you prefer running a local server, use Live Server extension in VS Code.)
🎯 How to Use
Open the app in your browser.
Upload a dataset (CSV or images).
Select the type of model you want to train.
Adjust settings like epochs or learning rate.
Click Train Model to start learning.
Watch graphs update in real time.
Export your trained model if you want to reuse it.
📊 Example Learning Scenarios
Classify handwritten numbers (MNIST).
Predict housing prices with CSV data.
Experiment with small image datasets (cats vs dogs).
Understand overfitting vs underfitting by changing epochs.
